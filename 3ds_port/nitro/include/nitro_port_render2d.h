 * overAlpha each covering pixel's alpha over the 3D (16: opaque; less: it
 * blends with the 3D by alpha / 16, as BLDCNT says). Where a window hides
 * the 3D, over shows what's behind it. The master brightness isn't
 * applied: it's for the compositor (masterBright), as is BLDCNT's effect
 * on the 3D itself (tint3d). Without a 3D layer (has3d 0: BG0 isn't the
 * 3D, or the display mode isn't the normal one), under is the whole
 * picture and over isn't touched. The caller provides over and overAlpha
