# The remaster display

On a New 3DS the port shows the game the way a 3DS game would show it,
rather than as a DS game in the middle of the screen. This is a display
path only: the game's own code, its 2D graphics and its 3D models are
untouched (except two small patches that tell the port where the game's
windows are and move the battle's health boxes; see "The wider screen").

What it does:

- **Bigger screens.** The DS's pictures are drawn 1.25 times bigger: the
  lower screen's 256x192 fills its 320x240 exactly; the upper screen is
  320 DS pixels wide (400x240), laid out for the wider screen (below).
- **Sharper 3D.** The 3D is drawn by the GPU straight into the screen at
  the screen's own resolution, not at the DS's 256x192 and then enlarged.
  The outlines the game draws round its 3D (the DS's edge marking) and its
  fog are drawn by the GPU too.
- **The wider screen.** On the upper screen the 3D fills all 400 pixels:
  the geometry engine widens the game's camera by a quarter (what was on
  screen stays where it was; the sides show more of the world), and the
  game's own visibility tests are given the wider view, so it draws what
  the sides show. The 2D is drawn on a canvas 320 pixels wide, nothing
  stretched (see "The wider screen").
- **Depth from the 3D slider.** The upper screen is drawn twice, the 3D
  shifted the opposite way for each eye, by how far each vertex is from the
  scene's middle distance (worked out per scene). 2D stays at the screen's
  depth; flat (orthographic) 3D too.
- **The pixels as they are.** By default each DS pixel becomes 2x2 texels
  and the GPU's bilinear filter scales the rest of the way: every pixel the
  same size, only its borders a texel soft (no blur, no uneven pixels).
  Scale2x and the others are settings.
- **Even pacing.** Each 3D scene is shown a fixed number of V-blanks after
  the game made it, with the 2D the DS would have shown it with (see
  "Timing").

## How it works

`3ds_port/game/app/port_compose_pica.c` puts each screen together on the
GPU, on the 3D thread, which becomes the display thread. The 2D renderer
draws an engine's picture in two layers (`NitroPort_Render2DSplit`,
`port_render2d.c`): what's behind the 3D (the picture without BG0) and the
layers in front of it, with each pixel's alpha over the 3D (a text box that
blends with the 3D, a semi-transparent sprite). The drawing threads draw
those as before (only when the 2D changed: the 3D no longer makes them
draw) and publish them into the textures of the screen the engine is on
(`port_upscale.c`; three sets a screen, so one can be drawn from, one be
the newest and one be written). A screen's frame is then: the layer
behind; the 3D's rear plane (fogged when the game says so); the polygons
(`port_gx3d_pica.c`, `NitroPort_PicaDrawScene`) with edge marking and fog;
a brightness effect on the 3D if the game has one; the layers in front;
the master brightness. A screen isn't drawn again until the V-blank after
its last frame was shown (its other framebuffer is on the LCD until then).

Edge marking on the GPU (the DS outlines a pixel of an opaque polygon when
a neighbouring pixel belongs to another polygon and is further away): for
each of the four directions the opaque polygons are drawn again, moved a
pixel and untextured, into a depth/stencil buffer of their own (so it holds
what's visible at each pixel's neighbour), then in place with that buffer
as the depth test: where they're nearer than the neighbour and the
neighbour's ID differs, they get their edge colour.

Fog: the DS fogs a pixel by its depth, through a 32-entry density table
starting at FOG_OFFSET, each entry 0x400 >> FOG_SHIFT depth units on
(DISP3DCNT). The PICA's fog takes a 128-entry table over its own depth, so
each scene's depth is put back into the DS's units (the vertex depth is
the DS's z or w, normalised per scene, linear) and the table is worked out
from the DS's (`setup_fog`, `fog_density`). Polygons fog where their
attribute's fog bit is set; the rear plane where the clear colour's is.
The intro's forest uses it (white fog, a linear table).

The vertex program (`gx3d_passthrough.v.pica`) does the view (where the
DS's screen goes on the 3DS's turned framebuffer) and the stereoscopic
shift: `x += strength * max(w - convergence, -w)`, for perspective
vertices (w > 1) only.

The GPU's command list is 1 MB; a draw that wouldn't fit is left out
rather than overflow it (an overflow stopped the GPU thread on the real
3DS). The `[perf] display` line says how full it got.

What's approximate, compared with the DS's compositing: a 2D layer in
front of the 3D blends with the 3D by its alpha (eva / 16) where the DS
blends by eva and evb separately; a 3D first target of alpha blending
(BLDCNT bit 0 with the alpha effect) isn't blended with the layer behind;
a brightness effect on the 3D applies to the whole 3D area regardless of
windows; the fog's alpha-only mode isn't drawn. `tests/test_render.c`
(`test_split_layers`, `test_wide_canvas`) checks the two layers put
together give the same picture as the renderer draws in one, where the
DS's result is exactly reproducible, and that the wider canvas's middle is
the DS's picture.

## The wider screen

The upper screen's 2D is drawn on a canvas 320 DS pixels wide, the DS's
x = 0 at 32 (`NitroRender2DSplit.width`/`origin`, laid out by
`NitroPort_WideLayout` in `port_wide.c`). The rules, so that nothing is
stretched:

- **BGs stop at the DS's edges** and the backdrop (the scene's own
  background colour) shows beyond, except where a BG's line is one colour
  at its edge (a picture's plain border, the black of a fade): that colour
  goes on to the screen's edge.
- **Pictures with plain middles and decorated sides** (the intro's red
  bars) are split: each half goes to its screen edge and the plain middle
  widens.
- **The battle background** is a picture wider than the DS's screen (a
  512-pixel map: the trainer's slide-in scrolls across it), so beyond the
  DS's edges it shows its own art.
- **The game's windows** (text boxes, menus, the place name sign) on the
  left of the screen move to its left edge, those on the right to its
  right edge; one across the middle (a text box) stays where it is. The
  game tells the port where its windows are
  (`patches/pokeplatinum/0012`).
- **The battle's health boxes** go to the screen's edges, the player's
  right and the opponent's left (`patches/pokeplatinum/0013`, by
  `NitroPort_WideScreenExtra`).
- **OBJs** (sprites) placed past the DS's edges show.
- **The 3D** is drawn wide (the camera widened) only while it's on the
  upper screen; the intro's flyover is on the lower screen, at the DS's
  width.

## Timing

Each 3D scene carries the V-blank count when the game finished it (its
SWAP), and each published 2D picture the count when the drawers read the
game's display state. A frame pairs the 3D with the newest 2D no newer
than the scene + 1 (the DS shows a scene the frame after its 2D was set),
and is shown `lag` V-blanks after the scene was made: the 3D comes at the
game's own even pace (every second V-blank in the field), not whenever a
scene happens to be done. `lag` starts at 3 and adapts: up when a frame
would be late, back down after ten seconds with room to spare.

## Settings

`sdmc:/3ds/pokeplatinum/remaster.txt`, a setting a line, `name value`:

| line | meaning |
|------|---------|
| `remaster off` | the classic display (the DS's pictures in the middle of the screens). The default on an Old 3DS. |
| `wide off` | the upper screen at the DS's width (320 of the 400 pixels), 2D and 3D |
| `filter sharp` | (the default) each pixel 2x2, then bilinear: the pixels as they are |
| `filter nearest` | nearest-neighbour: crisp, but pixels 1 or 2 screen pixels wide by turns |
| `filter smooth` | bilinear from the DS's pixels: soft |
| `filter scale2x` | Scale2x, then bilinear: diagonals rounded off |
| `stereo off` / `stereo 0.03` | no depth from the slider / its strength at full slider, in screen widths (default 0.02) |
| `convergence 400` | the distance (the DS's w) that's at the screen's depth, instead of each scene's middle |
| `edges off` | no outlines (edge marking) |
| `flip on` | the 2D layers upside down (if a GPU's texture rows come out the other way round) |

The log says what's on (`[compose] screens drawn by the GPU: ...`) and,
every two seconds, `[perf] display: N frames/s composed by the GPU, X ms of
GPU each; 2D layers published N/s, upscaled in X ms each; 3D shown N
V-blanks after the game made it, N frames late; GPU command list N% full
at most, N draws cut`.

## 60 frames a second in the 3D

The game runs its field at 30 frames a second: its main loop waits for two
V-blanks, and everything in the field (walking, the camera, animations)
moves in those steps. The display shows each of those steps evenly (see
"Timing"). Showing the field at a true 60 means drawing a frame of the
port's own in between each pair: the camera and every moving model
halfway, from the two scenes either side (matching each polygon of one
scene to the same polygon of the next, which the DS's command stream
doesn't say, so it has to be worked out from the display lists the game
sends). That's the next step for the display; it costs a frame of delay
(the in-between needs the scene after it).

## Known

- In the Azahar emulator, the field's 3D sometimes flashes black for a
  frame. Not seen on a real New 3DS, nor in the PC build. If it shows on a
  3DS, `edges off` in remaster.txt says whether it's the edge marking.
